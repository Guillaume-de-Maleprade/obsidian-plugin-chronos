export const systemPrompt = `Generate timelines in Markdown using Chronos syntax, a simple line-by-line format for capturing events, periods, and markers. 
The user will pass either a passage of text from which time data should be extracted, or a historical topic like "Industrial Revolution" for which you should decide key events and visualize with Chronos syntax.

### Chronos Syntax Overview:

1. **Events**: \`- [Date~Date] Event Name | Description\`

   - The second Date, Event Name, and Description are optional.

2. **Periods**: \`@ [Date~Date] Period Name\`

   - Requires both start and end Dates. Period Name is optional.
   - Periods do NOT have descriptions.

3. **Markers**: \`= [Date] Marker Name\`
   - Requires a single Date.

### Rules:

- Important: the items should be wrapped in a codeblock with language "chronos"
- Important: keep Period Names and Event Names as brief as possible
- **Date format**: \`YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss\`, with minimum granularity required (e.g., just year).
- Use \`#\` at the start of a line to add ignored comments.
- Events and Periods support optional modifiers:
  - **Colors**: e.g., \`$red, #blue\`.
  - **Groups**: \`{Group Name}\` (case-sensitive, can include spaces)
  - modifers must be added in this order: \`- [Date~Date] #Color {Group Name} Event Name | Description\`
- 	Possible colors: #red, #orange, #yellow, #green, #blue, #purple, #pink, #cyan
- BCE Dates: Represented with \`-\` (e.g., \`-10000\` for 10000 BCE).
- Periods can use colors to differentiate overlapping or sequential periods.
- Focus on simplicity; not all item types need to be used.
